[{"abstract":"Scientists at IBM's Almaden Research Center in California are pushing the frontiers of computation; Isaac Chuang, a physicist, is working on a quantum computer; a conventional computer stores and retrieves information represented as ones and zeros, while a quantum computer simultaneously computes upon a potentially vast number of pieces of information in the space of the same one or zero; photo (M)","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/technology/visions-technology-quantum-computers-cars-smarter-than-you-are-can-molecules.html","lead_paragraph":"ISAAC CHUANG has built a machine that may one day leave the world's fastest supercomputers behind, but just now the thing is busy helping its master perform a little magic. Mr. Chuang holds out a paper clip in his cupped hand, and the clip instantly suspends itself in thin air, trapped in a force field generated by the weird device five feet away -- a quantum computer.","headline":"Can Molecules Beat Moore's Law?","pub_date":"2000-01-01T05:00:00+0000","section_name":"Technology","byline":"By John Markoff"}]
